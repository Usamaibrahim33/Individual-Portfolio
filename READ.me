# My Frontend Personal Project: Image Gallery

## About the Project
This project is an Image Gallery built with React that fetches images using the Pixabay API. It enables users to search for images based on keywords and displays them in a responsive grid layout.

### Planning & Inspiration
- The project idea stemmed from the desire to create a visually appealing and user-friendly image gallery.
- Initial sketches and wireframes were created to plan the layout and structure.
- Inspiration was drawn from various image gallery websites and design resources like Dribbble and Behance.

### Tech Stack
- **React**: Utilized for building the frontend components and managing state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the components, providing a clean and responsive UI.
- **Pixabay API**: Integrated to fetch images based on user input.

### Why This Stack
- React was chosen for its component-based architecture, making it easier to manage and reuse UI elements.
- Tailwind CSS provided a fast and effective way to style components and ensure responsiveness.
- Pixabay API was selected for its extensive collection of high-quality images.

### What I Enjoyed
- Exploring and implementing the Pixabay API to dynamically fetch images based on user queries.
- Crafting a responsive grid layout to display the fetched images beautifully.

### What I Found Challenging
- Managing state effectively, especially while handling the loading state and displaying images.
- Balancing functionality with design elements to create an intuitive user experience.
